## Introduction

PanDelos-plus implements a dictionary-based method for pan-genome content discovery. This updated version is a re-engineered and parallelized C++ implementation of the original PanDelos. It integrates several Python modules with a C++ library, coordinated via the `execute.sh` Bash script, which facilitates streamlined access to the complete PanDelos-plus pipeline.

### Basic execution

A simple execution of the pipeline can be achieved by invoking:

```bash
bash execute.sh -i files/eschirichia.faa -o eschirichia
```

The execution of PanDelos-plus produces an output files named `escherichia.clus`, which contains the gene families computed by the pipeline.


Custom usage (`bash execute.sh -h`)

```bash
Usage: execute.sh [-i input_file] [-o output_file] [-t thread_num] [-m] [-d discard_value] [-g path to gbks] [-h] [-p]
Options:
  -i: Input file path
  -o: Output file path
  -t: Number of threads
  -m: Enable a different mode
  -d: Discard value (0 <= d <= 1, default 0.5)
  -h: Display this help message
  -g: Path to gbk files folder
  -f: for fragmented genes\n
  -p: For a stronger threshold (similarity parameter)
```

**_IMPORTANT_**
Note that the discard value will filter compared genes based on their length. For example:

```faa
NC_000913	NC_000913:NC_000913.3:b0001:1	thr operon leader peptide
MKRISTTITTTITITTGNGAG
NC_000913	NC_000913:NC_000913.3:b0018:1	regulatory protein MokC
MLNTCRVPLTDRKVKEKRAMKQHKAMIVALIVICITAVVAALVTRKDLCEVHIRTGQTEVAVFTAYESE
```

In the case of this pair the gene identified by `NC_000913:NC_000913.3:b0001:1` has a length equal to $69$ and the other has length equal to $21$ so a discard greater than $0.2$ will skip this comparison

### Input format

PanDelos-plus takes as input a complete set of gene sequences stored in a `.faa` text file belonging to any of the studied genomes.

This file must have a "2 line pattern" where:

-   The first line represents the identification line, composed of 3 parts (genome identifier, the gene identifier and the gene product) separated by a **tabulation** character.
-   The second line consists of the complete gene sequence in FASTA amino acid format reported in a single line.

**_IMPORTANT_**
No blank lines are admitted in the entire file.

Example of valid file composed of 5 genes grouped in 2 genomes

```faa
NC_000913	NC_000913:NC_000913.3:b0001:1	thr operon leader peptide

### Input format for fragmented genes

PanDelos-plus takes as input a complete set of gene sequences stored in a `.faa` text file belonging to any of the studied genomes.

This file must have a "2 line pattern" where:

-   The first line represents the identification line, composed of 4 parts (genome identifier, the gene identifier, the gene product and the number of inferred characters) separated by a **tabulation** character.
-   The second line consists of the complete gene sequence in FASTA amino acid format reported in a single line.

**_IMPORTANT_**
No blank lines are admitted in the entire file.

Example of valid file composed of 5 genes grouped in 2 genomes for fragmented genes

```faa
NC_000913	NC_000913:NC_000913.3:b0001:1	thr operon leader peptide   5

MTHPHDNIRVGAITFVYSVTKRGWVFHGLSVIRNPLKAQRLAEEINNKRGAVCTKHLLLS
```

**_IMPORTANT_**
Make sure that gene identifiers are unique within the input file. A suggested format to build unique gene identifier is `genome_identifier:gene_identifier:unque_integer`.

### Generation of the input file

In the case of completed genomes, the input file can be generated following these steps:

1.  Download the genomes of interest
2.  Create a folder with all interested .gbff files
3.  Change the extension of all .gbff files to .gbk (`find . -name '*.gbff' -exec bash -c 'mv "$0" "${0%.gbff}.gbk"' {} \;`)
4.  Check that all .gbk files are accepted `python3 scripts/gbk_checked.py {path_to_folder}` (path must end with '/')
5.  Generate the input file using `python3 example/gbk2ig.py {path_to_input_folder} {path_to_output_file}.faa` (path of input folder must end with '/')

### Output format

The execution of PanDelos-plus produces 2 output files named `[prefix_input_file].clus` and `[prefix_input_file].json` that reports the gene families discovered during the analysis. `[prefix_input_file].json` will be generated only if the `-g` flag is set to a correct gbk folder.

<br><br>

## Quick Start User Guide

1. Follow the installation steps using docker
2. Create a folder inside the `input` folder. `gbff_input` in this case.
3. Put `.gbff` inside `input/gbff_input` folder.
4. Run `gbff2gbk.py` script to convert `.gbff` to `.gbk`
5. Run `gbk_checker.py` check `.gbk` files
6. Run `gbk2ig.py` script to generate the input file
7. Start the analysis using the `execute.sh` script

### Overview of the commands

After the installation with Docker

```bash
mkdir -r input/gbff_input
```

Put your `.gbff` files inside

```bash
python3 scripts/gbff2gbk.py input/gbff_input/ input/gbff_input/
python3 scripts/gbk_checker.py input/gbff_input/
```

> You can face some errors like `Error processing a gbk file: 'locus_tag' not found`; in this case, the genome can't be processed, so it must be removed from the dataset.

```bash
python3 examples/gbk2ig.py input/gbff_input/ input/input.faa
```

```bash
bash execute.sh -i input/input.faa -o output/out -g input/gbff_input/
```

At the end, you will find inside the output folder `.json` and `.clus` files containing computed gene families

## Docker installation

We decided to prepare a docker container to make the usage of the tool easier.

### System requirements

To create and run the container, make sure to have installed the following packages:

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

If you want to check the installation of these packages you can run:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

### Directory setup

To share data with the container, you have to create 2 folders, one for the input, and one for the outputs.

If you are on Linux you can use this command

```bash
mkdir input
mkdir output
```

```bash
chmod 777 input
chmod 777 output
```

**Important**
Share folders must have r/w permissions set for all users

### Container build & run

You can build the container using

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
```

> Note that `docker compose` command may raise some errors so try also with `docker-compose`

To run the container

```bash
docker compose run pandelosplus --remove-orphans
```

### Usage

If you are inside the container, you can run the analysis as described in the following section and pay attention to input and output paths:

```bash
bash execute.sh -i <input/input_filename.faa> -o <output/filename>
```

#### Example of execution

The input folder contains a file called `salmonella.faa`, and output folder is empty, so you can run the analysis as follows

```bash
bash execute.sh -i <input/salmonella.faa> -o <output/salmonella>
```

The output folder will contain 2 files:

-   `salmonella.net`
-   `salmonella.clus`

<br><br>

## Local installation

### System requirements

> We suggest running the pipeline on a Linux-based machine.

PanDelos-plus can run on any operating system where Bash, Python3 (or higher), C++11 and [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org) are installed.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y bash python3 python3-pip build-essential time
```

Python packages:

```bash
pip3 install biopython
pip3 install networkx
pip3 install matplotlib
```

If you are running the latest version of Ubuntu, you may probably get this error:

```bash
× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
```

So you need to install the package using `apt` as follows

```bash
sudo apt install python3-biopython
sudo apt install python3-networkx
sudo apt install python3-matplotlib
```

### Compilation

The current repository contains a bash script `compile.sh` with a selection of compilation flags.

```bash
bash compile.sh
```

If something goes wrong with the script, is possible to compile as follows:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -O1 -o main
```

### Execution

The current repository contains a bash script `execute.sh` that takes an argument (the path to the input file), executes a sequence of tools (tools folder) and executes cpp software.

```bash
bash execute.sh -i <path_to_input_file.faa>
```

<br><br>

## Running the examples

### Requirements

To run examples, the following packages are required:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install gzip curl bash python3 python3-pip build-essential time
```

```bash
pip install biopython
pip install networkx
pip install matplotlib
```

As in the installation section, if you are running the latest version of Ubuntu, you may probably get this error:

```bash
× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
```

So you need to install the package using `apt` as follows

```bash
sudo apt install python3-biopython
sudo apt install python3-networkx
sudo apt install python3-matplotlib
```

### Run examples

To run all examples for PanDelos-plus' benchmarks

```bash
cd examples
python run_tests.py
```

The script will test a set of genomes retrieved from [NCBI](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) databases. Every test corresponds to a `.list.txt` file in `examples/lists/` that contains a different number of lines, each formatted in 3 columns, separated by a tabulation character `\t`, representing, in this order, Genome Assembly, GenBank and RefSeq.

Every test will create a folder named as the basename of the corresponding `.list.txt` file with this structure:

```bash
basename
├── banks
│  └── # all .gbk files used in the test
├── basename.faa # .faa file extracted from all gbk files contained in 'banks' folder
├── basename.png # with a bar plot with gene number for each genome
├── nets
│  └── # all .net file
├── plots
│  └── # list of .png files with plots
└── tmp.txt # a temporal file
```

---

## For developers

### Tools

This repository has a folder (`tools`) that contains a set of tools concatenated by `execute.sh` script. Current tools are:

-   `calculate_k.py` used to calculate kmers length given a `path_to_file.faa` file.
-   `netclu_ng.py`, which takes (in this order) the `path_to_file.faa` file and the respective `path_to_file.net` calculated by cpp software, and generates `.clus`.
-   `netclu_ng_plot.py`, that takes (in this order) `path_to_file.faa` file and the respective `path_to_file.net` calculated by cpp software, and generate `.clus` and a `.pdf` file
-   `clus2json.py` that takes a `path_to_file.clus` and generates a `.json` file.
-   `genesDistributions.py` that takes `path_to_file.faa` and generates a bar plot with the distribution of genes for each genome (`file.png`).
-   `gbk_checker.py` that checks if `.gbk` files are accepted.
-   `gbff2gbk.py` that converts `.gbff` to `.gbk` files.

### Installation

If the `compile.sh` script does not work properly, it is possible to compile as follows:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 <list_of_compilation_flags> -o main
```

> For compilation flags, check this [list of optimization options](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html).
> It's recommended to use at least `-O1` flag

**_IMPORTANT_**
The output file (`-o`) must be named `main` for the correct work of the pipeline.

### Execution

If you want a customized execution, you can run `./main -h` to see all possible options.

```bash
+-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+-+-+-+-+
|P| |a| |n| |D| |e| |l| |o| |s| |-| |P| |l| |u| |s|
+-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+-+-+-+-+
Usage:
-i to select the input file (path_to_file/file.faa)
-o to specify the file for output(path_to_file/file_name.extension)
-k to indicate the size of kmers
-t to indicate the number of threads
-m to activate specific mode with lower RAM cost (0 default)
-d to select a discard value (0 <= d <= 1) for similarity computation (0.5 default, a greater value implies a more aggressive discard)
-f for fragmented genes
```
